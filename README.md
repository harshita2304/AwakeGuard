AwakeGuard is designed as a comprehensive driver sleepiness detection and alert system. By monitoring physiological signals and driver behavior, it detects signs of drowsiness and alerts the driver to take necessary actions, thereby reducing the risk of accidents caused by drowsy driving and improving overall road safety.
